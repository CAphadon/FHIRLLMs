## Detailed Description

Create a FHIR json that is a bundle containing a Patient.

## Step 1: Import the necessary libraries
To create a FHIR JSON bundle, we need to import the `json` library to handle JSON data.

## Step 2: Define the Patient object
We need to define a Patient object with the required attributes such as `id`, `active`, `birthDate`, `gender`, `name`, and `telecom`.

## Step 3: Define the Bundle object
We need to define a Bundle object with the required attributes such as `type`, `timestamp`, and `entry`.

## Step 4: Create the Bundle entry
We need to create a Bundle entry with the Patient object and add it to the Bundle.

## Step 5: Convert the Bundle to JSON
We need to convert the Bundle object to a JSON string using the `json.dumps()` function.

## Step 6: Print the JSON string
We need to print the JSON string to the console.

Here is the code:
```
import json

# Define the Patient object
patient = {
    "resourceType": "Patient",
    "id": "12345",
    "active": True,
    "birthDate": "1990-01-01",
    "gender": "male",
    "name": [
        {
            "family": "Smith",
            "given": ["John"],
            "prefix": ["Mr."]
        }
    ],
    "telecom": [
        {
            "system": "phone",
            "value": "123-456-7890"
        }
    ]
}

# Define the Bundle object
bundle = {
    "resourceType": "Bundle",
    "type": "collection",
    "timestamp": "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "entry": [
        {
            "fullUrl": "http://example.com/patient/12345",
            "resource": patient
        }
    ]
}

# Convert the Bundle to JSON
json_string = json.dumps(bundle, indent=4)

# Print the JSON string
print(json_string)
```

## Example Use Case
This code can be used to create a FHIR JSON bundle containing a Patient object, which can be used to interact with FHIR servers or to store and retrieve patient data in a FHIR-compatible format. The resulting JSON string can be used in a variety of applications, such as healthcare information systems, clinical decision support systems, or data analytics tools.
