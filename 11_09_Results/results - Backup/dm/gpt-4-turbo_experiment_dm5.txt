To convert the given XML data to a FHIR JSON format, we need to extract and map relevant data fields from the XML to a FHIR JSON structure. The FHIR format is quite structured and requires specific fields to be filled according to the FHIR specification.

Here's a representation of the FHIR JSON based on the provided XML data:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Bundle",
  "type": "transaction",
  "entry": [
    {
      "fullUrl": "urn:uuid:123456789",
      "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Patient",
        "id": "123456789",
        "identifier": [
          {
            "use": "usual",
            "type": {
              "coding": [
                {
                  "system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203",
                  "code": "MR"
                }
              ]
            },
            "value": "Q123456"
          },
          {
            "use": "secondary",
            "type": {
              "coding": [
                {
                  "system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203",
                  "code": "NIIP"
                }
              ]
            },
            "value": "555555"
          }
        ],
        "name": [
          {
            "family": "Mustermann",
            "given": [
              "Max"
            ]
          }
        ],
        "gender": "male",
        "birthDate": "2023-04-02",
        "address": [
          {
            "line": [
              "Bahnhofstr. 1"
            ],
            "city": "Tuebingen",
            "postalCode": "70070",
            "country": "DE"
          }
        ]
      },
      "request": {
        "method": "POST",
        "url": "Patient"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of the Mapping:
1. **Bundle and Transaction**: The FHIR JSON is structured as a Bundle with a type of "transaction". Each entry represents a request to create or update a resource.

2. **Patient Resource**:
   - **fullUrl and ID**: A unique identifier (UUID or logical ID) is assigned to the resource.
   - **identifier**: Patient identifiers are mapped. The "usual" identifier uses the patient's insurance number and the "secondary" uses the health insurance company number.
   - **name**: Patient's last name and first name are included.
   - **gender**: Mapped from XML, with 'M' translated to 'male'.
   - **birthDate**: The birthdate is formatted to the FHIR standard (YYYY-MM-DD).
   - **address**: Includes street, city, postal code, and country.

3. **Request Details**: Each entry specifies a method (POST) and the type of resource (Patient) for the transaction.

This JSON structure adheres to the FHIR specifications and is tailored to encapsulate the patient data from the provided XML in a structured manner suitable for a wide range of healthcare applications and systems.
