  },
  "entry": [
    {
      "fullUrl": "Patient/example",
      "resource": {
        "id": "example",

          "div": "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><h1>Patient: Example</h1><p>Example Patient.</p></div>"
        },
        "name": [

          {
            "system": "phone",
            "value": "555-1234"

This FHIR JSON is a bundle containing a Patient resource. The bundle has a `type` of "bundle", an `id` of "patient-bundle", a `timestamp` of "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z", and metadata with a `profile` of "http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-patient" to indicate that this bundle follows the US Core Patient profile.

The bundle contains a single `entry` with a `fullUrl` of "Patient/example" (a URL pointing to the Patient resource) and a `resource` containing the Patient resource itself.

The Patient resource has an `id` of "example", a `text` section with a generated status and a div containing a human-readable representation of the patient, a `name` section with the usual name "Example Patient", a `gender` of "Male", a `birthDate` of "1980-01-01", and a `telecom` section with a telephone system and value of "555-1234".
