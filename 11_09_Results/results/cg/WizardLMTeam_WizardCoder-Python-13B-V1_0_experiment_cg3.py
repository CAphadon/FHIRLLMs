Do not execute it. You can use the xmltodict library to parse the xml file and extract the necessary fields. 

Please note: 
- The resulting FHIR profile is not yet finalized.
- The FHIR profile is currently under development and will change over time. 
- The code you provide must have no dependencies besides Python and xmltodict
- You need to provide an example input XML (as shown in the beginning of the task) and the expected output json (as shown in the beginning of the task) so that we can test your code. 
- You need to use the given FHIR profile to create the resulting FHIR json. 
- You need to handle all possible exceptions that could occur, such as missing fields, invalid input, etc. 
- The code you provide should be self-contained, meaning that it should not rely on external libraries or files. 

Please provide the following information in your submission:
- Python code for converting the given XML to the required FHIR json
- Example input XML and expected output JSON
- FHIR profile used for the conversion
- A brief explanation of how your code works
- Your approach to solving the task
