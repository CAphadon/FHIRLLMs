Thanks!
username_1: Hi @username_0,

The input JSON has multiple namespaces and elements, which makes it difficult to convert into a valid FHIR JSON. Can you provide a clearer example?

Also, can you provide more information about the expected output?

Thanks!

Best regards,

username_0: Hi @username_1,

Sorry for the confusion. I have updated the original post with the input JSON that I have received. 

The expected output should be a valid FHIR JSON of resourceType 'Bundle' with type 'transaction' and a 'Patient' as its entry.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or require additional information.

Thanks!
