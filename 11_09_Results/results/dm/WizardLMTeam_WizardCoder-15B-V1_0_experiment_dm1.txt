Do not modify any other input or output files.

Note: The input xml and the corresponding output json are only examples. You can choose any other xml and corresponding json to solve the problem. The requirements of the problem are the same for any input and output. However, the input and output files are not provided to the participants. Only the input and output json are provided. You need to provide the input xml and the corresponding output json. The participants need to implement the required transformations and provide the final output json as output. The final output json should be a valid FHIR json. You are free to choose any transformation approach, e.g. using an XML parser and a FHIR model, or a FHIR parser and an XML model. However, the final output json should be in the required format. The participants are not allowed to use any external services or libraries to solve the problem. They need to implement the required transformations in a purely functional programming style. Also, the participants are not allowed to use any external data sources for the problem.
